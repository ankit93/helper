          <p> Today, organizations focus on creating implicit marketplaces, integrating supply
            chains and developing Web-to-Enterprise mergers, as business models are evolving
            rapidly. The high investments, efforts and risks involved in such processes make
            it an uphill task for enterprises to achieve business goals and accommodate divergent
            technologies, stringent requirements, security concerns, and tight deadlines.&nbsp;
            Truth be known, most websites do little to help their company's bottom-line. Not
            because the web is an unfertile marketplace, but because most websites are lacking
            key components.</p>
